! XMODMAP configuration
! -------------------------------
! This layout is mainly designed to minimize use of 'weak' fingers and
! increase ergonomic.

! Swap Ctrl and Alt keys on the keyboard
! The Ctrl key is a very frequently used key and requires use of predominantly
! of your left hand pinky finger. Swapping to Alt forces you to use another
! finger for this key.
clear control
clear mod1
keycode 37 = Alt_L Meta_L
keycode 64 = Control_L
add control = Control_L Control_R
add mod1 = Alt_L Meta_L

! Caps lock is not a key I ever want to hit. Usually I end up hitting this key
! by mistake. Instead remap this key to tilde, which is located in an even
! less ergonomic location
keycode 66 = asciitilde

! Swap semicolon and colon. Colon is frequently used in vim and this makes this
! key more accessible.
keycode 47 = colon semicolon
